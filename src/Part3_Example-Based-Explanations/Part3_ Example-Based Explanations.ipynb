Criticisms, on the other hand, highlight outliers or edge cases that are poorly represented by the prototypes, revealing areas where the model may struggle or perform poorly. These outliers are crucial for identifying anomalies, improving model robustness, and addressing underrepresented groups in the dataset, which is especially important for ensuring fairness in high-stakes applications like healthcare or finance.
